## 2 How it work?

### Smart Contracts - Trust and Transparency

+ The heart of our service lies in smart contracts. These self-executing contracts are encoded on the blockchain and contain predefined rules and conditions for each job.
+ When a freelancer and employer agree to work together, a smart contract is automatically created, defining the terms of the agreement, such as payment, deadline, and deliverables
+ The use of smart contracts ensures complete transparency and eliminates the need for intermediaries. Once the contract is executed, all parties can view its details, providing a verifiable record of the job's agreement

### Decentralization - Empowering the Community
+ We embrace the power of decentralization. Our platform operates on a distributed network of nodes, removing the need for a central authority
+ Each transaction and job-related data are recorded and shared across the network, ensuring security and immutability. No single entity has control over the platform, making it resilient to censorship and single points of failure
+ This decentralized nature empowers our freelancer community with autonomy and ensures a fair and equitable environment for all participants

### Secure Payments - Timely and Reliable
+ Bid farewell to payment hassles and delays. With our Pawo Platform, payments are streamlined and secure. When the freelancer completes the job and meets the predefined criteria, the smart contract automatically triggers the payment process
+ Funds are directly transferred from the employer's digital wallet to the freelancer's wallet in a matter of minutes. There's no need for invoicing, waiting for approvals, or dealing with payment gateways
+ This automated payment system not only accelerates the payment process but also protects both freelancers and employers from potential payment disputes

### Immutable Reviews and Ratings
+ Transparency is at the core of our platform. Upon job completion, employers can provide reviews and ratings for the freelancer's performance, and vice versa
+ These reviews are recorded on the blockchain, making them immutable and tamper-proof. Freelancers can build a strong reputation based on their work history, and employers can make informed decisions based on verified feedback
+ This feedback system enhances trust within our community, promoting quality work and fostering long-term professional relationships

### Global Opportunities and Connectivity
+ Embrace borderless freelancing. Our Pawo Platform connects talented individuals and employers from all around the world
+ Freelancers gain access to a wide range of job opportunities across various industries and geographic locations, opening doors to a global clientele
+ Employers can tap into a diverse talent pool, finding the perfect match for their projects without geographical limitations
