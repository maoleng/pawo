## 2 How it work?

### Smart Contracts - Trust and Transparency

<table border="1px solid white">
	<tr>
		<td>The heart of our service lies in smart contracts. These self-executing contracts are encoded on the blockchain and contain predefined rules and conditions for each job.</td>
        <td>When a freelancer and employer agree to work together, a smart contract is automatically created, defining the terms of the agreement, such as payment, deadline, and deliverables</td>
		<td>The use of smart contracts ensures complete transparency and eliminates the need for intermediaries. Once the contract is executed, all parties can view its details, providing a verifiable record of the job's agreement</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Decentralization - Empowering the Community

<table border="1px solid white">
	<tr>
		<td>We embrace the power of decentralization. Our platform operates on a distributed network of nodes, removing the need for a central authority</td>
		<td>Each transaction and job-related data are recorded and shared across the network, ensuring security and immutability. No single entity has control over the platform, making it resilient to censorship and single points of failure</td>
		<td>This decentralized nature empowers our freelancer community with autonomy and ensures a fair and equitable environment for all participants</td>
	</tr>

	</tr>

		<td>These reviews are recorded on the blockchain, making them immutable and tamper-proof. Freelancers can build a strong reputation based on their work history, and employers can make informed decisions based on verified feedback</td>
		<td>This feedback system enhances trust within our community, promoting quality work and fostering long-term professional relationships</td>
